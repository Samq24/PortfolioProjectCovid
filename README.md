# PortfolioProjectCovid
This is a simple project where I decided to explore global data on Covid-19. My main objective was to gather updated information on cases and deaths, as well as analyze the impact of mobility during the pandemic and the CO2 emissions associated with the primary fuel sources such as oil, gas, and carbon.

Firstly, I collected the up-to-date Covid-19 data in CSV format from ourworldindata.org. Then, I searched for mobility data during the pandemic, which I downloaded in CSV format from google.com/covid19/mobility/. Lastly, I obtained the CO2 emissions data from oil, gas, and carbon from ourworldindata.org once again.

Once I had the data, I formulated a series of questions that I considered fundamental to my initial project:

- Comparison between the total number of cases and the total number of deaths.
- Percentage of deaths in relation to the population.
- Countries with the highest infection rate compared to their population.
- Continents with the highest number of deaths.
- Global statistics.
- Evolution of workplace mobility in relation to the total number of cases.
- Possible correlation between changes in mobility in parks and the number of new Covid-19 deaths.
- Changes in mobility at transit stations compared to the implemented stringency index.
- CO2 emissions from primary fuel sources such as oil, gas, and carbon.

If you would like to access the Covid data, you can find it at ourworldindata.org/coronavirus, as the file sizes exceed the capacity to upload them here.
